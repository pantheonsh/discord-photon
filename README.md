# Discord Photon
A WIP Discord client with an interface which mimicks the official client. It uses `discord.js` for talking with the server and `blessed` for the UI.

It doesn't have any kind of functionality yet.

## Why?
Because I can. And also because Electron sucks. It comes with its own version of Chromium (which has ~20 million LOC), and Node.js. RAM isn't cheap.
